## 🧭 Welcome, Explorer! I'm Javier.

I'm a frontend developer with a strong passion for embedded systems and hardware tinkering. Currently, I'm on a continuous journey to deepen my expertise, both in modern web technologies and low-level embedded development.

Wanna see more of what I'm building (or breaking)?

## 🧰 What I’m Building

Here’s a peek into the stuff I’ve been obsessing over lately:
<br>

#### [BLE Macro Keyboard with Layered Configs](https://github.com/javierrayhan/kato-macro-esp32)
> A custom BLE HID macro pad powered by **ESP32**, featuring 7 tactile keys and a rotary encoder, with seamless switching between 7 user-defined layers for advanced input control.

#### [ATmega32 CLI-based OS](https://github.com/javierrayhan/elena_cli-os)
> A bare-metal minimalist CLI OS, communicating over UART, packed into just **32KB** flash. Features include pin I/O control, I2C scanner, real-time clock, and a simple user management system, all without an RTOS.

#### [Qurban Finance Web App](https://github.com/javierrayhan/qurbanin-alhuda)
> A dedicated web app for the [Qurban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Udhiyah) community in my village for helping participants keep track of their savings, view contribution history, and manage their qurban preparations in a transparent, **user-friendly** way.
